High volatility expected, manage risks carefully
Benchmark stock market indices experienced a significant drop, closing down more than 2.5%. This slump came after a global selloff in equities, driven by worries about a potential slowdown in the US economy.

The S&P BSE Sensex fell by 2,222.55 points to end at 56,941.47, while the NSE Nifty50 dropped by 662.10 points, closing at 24,055.60.

Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President of Research at Religare Broking Ltd, commented on the situation and said that the markets plunged sharply on Monday, losing over 2.5% due to weak global cues.

"After a gap-down start, the Nifty index inched lower throughout the day, briefly falling below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support zone around 23,950 before closing at 24,055.60. All key sectors saw declines, with realty, metal, and energy sectors being the biggest losers. The broader indices also faced losses ranging from 3.6% to 4.6%," he said.

Mishra advised investors to avoid panicking over short-term market movements. "Instead, view these corrections as chances to buy quality stocks at lower prices with a long-term outlook. For new investments, focus on sectors or themes that cater to the domestic market."

"We expect continued volatility in the near future due to various global issues, including the unwinding of Yen carry trades, recession fears in the US, and rising tensions in the Middle East. For the Nifty index, we see the 23,250-23,400 zone as key support, while the 24,500-24,700 zone will act as resistance if there is a rebound."

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, provided a longer-term perspective and said, "Historically, the Indian market has shown strong performance compared to global markets over the long term. This trend is expected to continue, supported by robust GDP growth forecasts, progressive policies, fiscal discipline, and a favourable political environment."

Rajesh Bhosale, an Equity Technical Analyst at Angel One, noted a sharp rise in market volatility.

"India Vix spiked by 42% to surpass the 20 mark. We expect volatility to remain high, so it's important to manage risks carefully and stay updated on global developments, as these will likely impact our markets in the near term."

While the recent market downturn has caused concern, experts suggest that investors should focus on long-term strategies and be prepared for ongoing volatility.
