Text: Acetone has seen some dramatic lows and highs since 2018. Global supply has gone from huge oversupply to very tight in less than two years. During the Covid-19 lockdown, most petrochemicals values tumbled, but acetone prices remained fairly steady. And while markets were starting to open up slowly, acetone bucked most trends by rocketing to new highs this month. However, several factors indicate that acetone’s favorable trajectory may draw to an end in the latter half of 2020.
Text: Acetone spot prices in Europe soared in July and are expected to climb beyond €1000/ ton in August. Demand is good, but the region's very short supply drives the strength in pricing. Suppliers are reporting that customers are ‘desperate’ for material.
Text: Demand for acetone’s co-product phenol has been slipping since mid-2019 after being hit hard by a slowing economy and a poor-performing car industry. As a result, phenol operating rates had to be turned down, but this supply remained long, and prices, as a result, continued to weaken. However, acetone demand had remained healthy during this time, and this, combined with lower run rates, saw availability become quite tight at the start of 2020. Then, attractive arbitrage opportunities to China and the US during May and June diverted volumes away from Europe, further tightening the market.
Text: Acetone demand has been driven by growing demand for isopropanol (IPA), which has moved into acute shortage over the past three months since one of its uses is in hand sanitizers, a market it shares with ethanol. Demand for hand sanitizers has shot up since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, for use not only in hospitals but in homes and many public places. This has resulted in a huge escalation in prices worldwide. IPA can be made from propylene or acetone, and both routes have been highly profitable in the past few months. As a result, acetone demand for IPA has been very strong in recent months, but in July, market participants reported that demand was starting to stabilize.
Text: Phenol producers in Europe have been reporting that demand has started to pick up from their end-use sectors, with automobiles, the hardest-hit industry, also showing signs of improvement. If this continues, operating rates will be increased, and acetone supply coupled with falling IPA demand could see prices under downward pressure. But this could be capped by a supply shortage in Q3/Q4 when several turnarounds in the European domestic market occur. These include Sequens in France, which will be down in August; Domo, which will shut down in September; Ineos, which will have its Gladbeck plant down for a turnaround in October/November; and Cepsa, which will have one line down in October. Borealis and Versalis have delayed their turnarounds until Q1 next year.
Text: The acetone spot market remains strong in the US as supply has remained very tight despite arbitrage opportunities for Asian and European importers. Demand from coatings and solvents has been impacted the most by Covid-19, but improved offtake volumes from IPA and MMA sectors gave the acetone industry a much-needed boost during the dark days of the pandemic. However, market participants report that demand from IPA for hand sanitizers has started to soften from peak levels.
Text: In the past several months, the supply of acetone in China has been tight because of high consumption from the IPA sector and a heavy turnaround schedule in the domestic market. But most producers restarted this month except Sinopec Mitsui. Although acetone supply is well balanced, market sentiment is being weighed down by expectations that supply will increase when Zhejiang Petrochemical starts its phenol/acetone plant and import cargoes from Saudi Arabia resume following the completion of Rabigh’s turnaround. IPA operating rates fell slightly in May; competition in this market has become fierce as several new IPA capacities have come online. When acetone prices hit high levels, only IPA producers could afford the high prices. MIBK plants were forced to shut down for some time, and MMA producers had to keep their operating rates low. The other downstream sectors resisted paying high acetone prices, which saw a quick decline in IPA values. It should be noted that IPA prices in Europe have been driven higher by strong demand that far exceeds supply. On the other hand, in China, IPA prices have been forced up mainly by the rising costs of acetone.
Text: Phenol demand in all regions is showing signs of improving. As a result, operating rates will be increased to meet growing demand. However, acetone offtake volumes have slipped slightly in the last few weeks. IPA demand seems to be falling from peak levels seen in May/June, and the other end-use industries have been struggling to pay the high acetone prices, therefore exerting some downward pressure. In Europe, many turnarounds, while Shell in the US is also due to shut for a 45-day turnaround in September, will see supply become tight. However, market participants are not confident that acetone prices will maintain their strong position. With new capacity in China and import volumes rising again from Saudi Arabia to China, it is possible that the industry could find itself back in a global glut. Either scenario is possible, but acetone’s fate over the next few months will be largely determined by phenol and isopropanol demand.

Text: Hydroalcoholic gels plant in Spain, Photo: Cepsa
Text: Cepsa continues to develop and diversify its chemicals business by starting the construction of a new isopropyl alcohol (IPA) plant, the first of its kind in Spain. This product is used not only in hydroalcoholic gels, but also in household and industrial cleaning products. 
Text: The new IPA plant, backed by a €75 million investment, will be located in Palos de la Frontera (Huelva) and will be the first plant of its kind in Spain to use green hydrogen and capable to replace fossil-based raw materials in the production of isopropyl alcohol with sustainable alternatives. This will expand Cepsa Química's range of more sustainable products, in line with Cepsa's Positive Motion energy transition strategy.
Text: For José María Solana, CEO of Cepsa Química, the IPA project “is a very important step in our Next Chemicals in Positive Motion strategy. The plant will be linked to our Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley, ensuring that our activities are fully in line with our commitment to advance the fight against climate change and accelerate the ecological transition. It will also strengthen Spain's supply autonomy in these types of products.”
Text: The Regional Minister of Industry, Energy, and Mines of the Government of Andalusia, Jorge Paradela, emphasized that Cepsa's new chemical plant in Palos is "a tangible example of how innovation, sustainability, and job creation can go hand in hand, driving economic growth and the well-being of European society."
Text: “It is demonstrated that energy at competitive prices is a factor in industrial location," and he highlighted that it will contribute decisively to "Spain gaining strategic autonomy by being the first facility in the country to produce the raw material for making renewable-origin hydroalcoholic gel."
Text: Isopropyl alcohol is also used as a solvent in the manufacturing of paints, coatings, and printing inks, as well as an intermediate in the production of key ingredients in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agrochemical industries.
Text: The new facility, scheduled for completion by the end of 2025, will have a production capacity of 80,000 tons per year. It’s estimated that approximately 400,000 hours of work will be required to build this new plant, including both direct and indirect labor.

Text: When the world’s most successful company proclaims the removal of a contentious chemical from its portfolio, it’s wise to wonder if the world will soon follow suit.
Text: Apple’s claim that its iPhone product range is PVC and phthalates-free – excluding AC power cords in South Korea and (two-pronged AC cords) in India and Thailand – demonstrates the availability and widespread acceptance of phthalates alternatives. 
Text: The tech giant’s vocal stance will have been welcomed by lobbyists seeking to end the plasticizers’ use in consumer products. It has not, however, dampened worldwide phthalates demand since 2013. Post-Covid demand has been strong across most sectors worldwide – except the lagging automotive industry.
Text: Esters of phthalic acid for softening, or plasticizing PVC, are correctly called orthophthalate plasticizers. As of 2022, they remain largely free of the regulation (excepting DEHP; see below) and are used in a range of applications worldwide. Those uses include automotive, electric wiring, flooring, furniture, shoes, bags, medi­cal blood bags, and – perhaps most controversially – food contact materials (FCM) like plastic packaging.
Text:  
Text: The fact that phthalates do not chemically bind to the materials to which they are added makes them liable to leach out over time. This increases their exposure to humans. To avoid boycotts on that basis, companies have evolved plasticizers demonstrating high molecular weight (HMW). The philosophy is that the bigger the molecule, the more likely it remains inside the polymer structure.
Text: But not all phthalates survived. Until 2015, the chemical substance di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) – also known as dioctyl phthalate (DOP) – was widely used. An LMW compound remains approved for use in medical devices across most jurisdictions – largely due to a lack of effective replacements.
Text: DEHP (DOP) was however, among the first chemicals to be assigned a REACH ‘sunset date’ by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) – a move that attached subsequent conditions to its use. The ruling followed an attempt by Denmark to compel ECHA to add several phthalates to its Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) list in 2014.
Text: In Europe, following the sunset ruling, DEHP (DOP) became subject to regulations. But in the US and Canada too, the phthalate is now restricted for use in toys, childcare articles and cosmetics. In France, it has been banned since 2015.
Text: With the demise of DEHP (DOP), dioctyl terephthalate – also called di(ethylhexyl) terephthalate – (DOTP) and diisononylphthalate, or diisononyl-1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid (DINP) became common substitutes.
Text: DOTP is a non-phthalate plasticizer, but DINP is a phthalate plasticizer and in 2018, Denmark failed to persuade ECHA's Risk Assessment Committee to classify DINP as a category 1B reproductive toxicant. This was despite the Scandinavian country's earlier success in initiating restrictions for DEHP (DOP)
Text: Largely manufactured in Europe, DINP features in the International Chemical Secretariat's (ChemSec) SIN List. The list includes chemicals likely to become legally restricted under EU REACH regulation in the future. Listed since 2008, ChemSec continues to support the compound’s inclusion despite requests for its removal and repeated questioning from industry representatives, the organization says.
Text: Already, we've heard of reduced supply as producers turn their focus to DINCH, which is obtained by hydrogenating DINP.
Text: Yazmine Khan, Tecnon OrbiChem Senior Consultant, Plasticisers, Oxo alcohols, Olefins & Aromatics
Text: ExxonMobil’s regulatory affairs advisor David Adenuga laments the ‘common misconception’ to view all orthophthalates as the same. He says their inherent differences necessitated that every phthalate be evaluated on its merit.
Text: ‘Depending on the size of the alcohol that is used to manufacture them, all phthalates are distinct in terms of their properties, their performance, and the way that they interact with the human body,’ he says.
Text: DINP and DIDP are ‘two of the most studied chemicals in commerce today’ Adenuga says. Highlighting reviews by regulatory agencies including the ECHA and the UK Committee on Toxicology, he says DINP and DIPD ‘pose no human health when used as intended, are not classified for any human health effects and is not considered to be SVHCs’. Similar validations have emerged from investigations by Health Canada and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission in the last 10 years, he says. Except for parts per million limits in specific children’s items, ‘there are no content limits on the use of DINP and DIDP in existing applications.
Text: Highlighting a European Food Safety Agency safety evaluation covering DINP and DIDP1 in food – first released in February 2019 – Adenuga says, "Exposure in the European diet was at least 20 times below the level that is safe." In conclusion, Adenuga says that contrary to media portrayals, "Phthalates like DINP and DIDP pose no health concern in food."
Text: Tecnon OrbiChem senior consultant Yazmine Khan (pictured below) specializes in plasticizers and oxo alcohols. She highlighted a 'noticeable shift' in demand from phthalate plasticizers to phthalate-free plasticizers. 
Text: "DEHP (or DOP) has been phased out in favor of dioctyl terephthalate – also called di(ethylhexyl) terephthalate – (DOTP). In Europe, the change has been driven by regulation.' She added that only small amounts of DEHP (DOP) production remain there – coming from Polynt and Deza – and mostly for medical end uses such as blood bags.
Text: Other factors, such as lower prices for terephthalic acid (a key feedstock for DOTP) due to mass expansions in China to feed the PET industry, also accelerated the transition.
Text: The search for alternatives to orthophthalates led to the development of DOTP as an alternative. The term 'phthalates' is often used as a shorthand for 'orthophthalates,' and DOTP, being a terephthalate, is not considered a 'phthalate."
Text: "The phasing out hasn’t come without issues,' Khan added. 'DOTP production in Europe is limited and the market relies heavily on imports. Supply issues due to a lack of imports in recent years have driven up demand for DINP again. DINP is a phthalate plasticizer but remains the largest plasticizer by volume in the US and Europe and many end users can switch between DOTP and DINP.  There is significantly more DINP capacity in Europe with majors such as ExxonMobil, Evonik, and BASF all producing it in the region." Consequently, she said, supply is rarely an issue – unless there is disruption due to unplanned production outages or a force majeure, for example. 
Text:  
Text: DOTP and DINP compete against each other and there is a big overlap in end uses. Historically, prices had been in the same range moving in line with each other. However, since late 2020 and early 2021, there has been a divergence due to differences in key raw material prices and availability.
Text: For DOTP in particular, prices in Europe and the US were impacted by higher 2-ethylhexanol pricing due to production issues, and spiking propylene and natural gas costs.
Text: Khan warns that further investigation into DINP cannot be ruled out. 'Already, we've heard of reduced supply as producers turn their focus to DINCH, which is obtained by hydrogenating DINP.
Text: There's a growing interest in non-orthophthalate and bio-based plasticizers including DOTP-based products. In 2015, Poland's Grupa Azoty announced that its Oxoviflex (DOTP) plasticizer met European standards for use in FCM, children's articles and medical devices. The company now has a capacity for 82 ktpa of DOTP, its phthalates-free replacement. Europe's other producer is Valtris Specialty Chemicals with a nameplate capacity of 45 ktpa for DOTP. While some supplies are met by Asian and Turkey-based manufacturers, the limit to just two European producers can make markets tight. It is also one of the key reasons why DINP remains widely used. The Russian producer SIBUR had also been aggressive in supplying DOTP to the European market, but volumes have reduced over time, partly due to domestic Russian consumption.
Text: Belgium-based chemicals manufacturer Proviron offers solutions for applications including demanding, sensitive, and food contact. And UK-headquartered Croda markets monomeric plasticizers described as phthalate-free on its website.
Text: A non-phthalate ingredient manufactured by Gujarat; India-based Mamta Polycoats is called triethyl citrate. According to the company, it is suitable for use in applications including personal care, detergents and cleaning products, healthcare as well as food and beverages. Dioctyl adipate – a phthalate-free plasticizer – is produced by Eastman, BASF, and India’s Nayakem.
Text: And LG Chem’s LGflex GL300 is a non-phthalate plasticizer for use in applications including wiring, flooring and artificial leather. 
Text: Germany’s Evonik and BASF have both developed isononanol-based durable plasticizers for demanding and extreme applications. 1,2-Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH) plasticizers generate interest because they are suitable for use in children’s toys and other sensitive applications because they are non-phthalate plasticizers.
Text: The toxicological research investment for BASF's non-orthophthalate Hexamoll DINCH plasticizer amounted to more than €7 million, the company says. The spending serves to ensure BASF's investment will stand the test of time in an ever-changing legislative landscape.

Title: Isopropyl Alcohol Prices on the Rise in North America Amidst Increasing Demand
Text: Welcome To ChemAnalyst
Text: 
	With the beginning of August 2023, the prices of Isopropyl Alcohol demonstrate a slight upward trajectory across the North American region, primarily in the United States. Rising cost pressure from the upstream market, a surge in downstream demand, and mounting trading activities are some of the factors driving the market trend of Isopropyl Alcohol.

	Isopropyl Alcohol prices in the United States have steadily increased due to a moderate rise in domestic inquiries and a surge in consumption from the downstream Pharmaceutical, Personal Care, and Electronics sectors. Additionally, an upward progression of feedstock propylene prices in early August further supported this upward price trend for Isopropyl Alcohol. However, as per the knowledge, the United States imports Isopropyl Alcohol from South Korea, apart from Canada, which results in another factor contributing to its surging prices. As the supply activity from South Korea was weak since the previous month and, on the contrary, downstream demand for Isopropyl Alcohol was strong in the exporting nations. Due to inadequate supply for Isopropyl Alcohol to meet the demand, the ongoing war in Ukraine has disrupted the global supply chain. Furthermore, it is expected that the supply activity from South Korea until the very end of August will remain weak, while the demand for Isopropyl Alcohol is expected to remain strong, but the supply is unlikely to improve significantly. This is because the factors that led to the weak supply in July 2023 are still in place.

	Apart from that, Super Typhoon Doksuri in the Pacific Ocean affected the exporting activity in the USA. The Typhoon resulted in widespread damage in South Korea and Japan, disrupting supply chains and significantly delaying shipments. This had a knock-on effect on US exporting activity, as many businesses rely on components and materials from these countries. The impact of the Typhoon on US exporting activity is likely to be felt for several months, as businesses are likely to review their supply chain management practices to mitigate the risk of future disruptions. In the interim, crude oil costs on the upstream front in the US market have been experiencing an upward trend following OPEC's production cuts. As of the first week of August, the prices of Crude oil across the US market were settled with a consistent hike of 2.77 percent.

	Moreover, as per the ChemAnalyst forecast, the price of Isopropyl Alcohol is expected to witness a mixed price trajectory. Isopropyl Alcohol demand from the downstream sector is likely to drop down in the forthcoming month, while the inventory level is projected to remain on the upper side, which might balance the overall requirements across the nation.

Title: OQ Chemicals Implements Force Majeure for Products in Oberhausen Facility
Text: Welcome To ChemAnalyst
Text: 
	OQ Chemicals has announced the declaration of force majeure for specific products manufactured at its Oberhausen, Germany facility, citing a significant disruption at a raw material supplier. On February 27, a substantial operational disturbance occurred at the synthesis gas unit of a raw material supplier situated at OQ Chemicals' Oberhausen site. This particular partner produces technical gases, including synthesis gas, which serves as crucial raw material supplied to OQ Chemicals for further processing. Consequently, the affected unit of the raw material supplier underwent automatic shutdown procedures. Following the incident, four individuals underwent precautionary medical evaluations and were subsequently discharged from the hospital on the same day.

	The halt in the production of synthesis gas has led to supply limitations for various products produced by OQ Chemicals in Oberhausen, pending further updates. These products include Isobutyraldehyde, n-Butyraldehyde, n-Butanol, i-Butanol, 2-Ethylhexanol, n-Butyl acetate, n-Butylamine (all grades), TCD Alcohol DM, Neopentyl Glycol, n-Propionaldehyde, Isovaleraldehyde, 2-Methylbutyric acid, 2-Ethylhexanoic acid, n-Butyric acid, Isobutyric acid, Isononanoic acid, Isopentanoic acid, Isovaleric acid, n-Valeric acid, OXSOFT 3G8, and OXFILM 351.

	At present, OQ Chemicals is unable to furnish detailed information regarding the duration of this situation. Nevertheless, the company has promptly notified its customers and is actively engaged in efforts to mitigate the impact on supply chains while striving to expedite the resumption of production at the earliest feasible juncture.

	OQ Chemicals, formerly known as Oxea, stands as a prominent global producer of Oxo Intermediates and Oxo Performance Chemicals. With a diverse product portfolio essential for the production of high-quality coatings, lubricants, and plastics, the company occupies a crucial position across multiple industries. Employing over 1,400 individuals worldwide and distributing its products in more than 60 countries, OQ Chemicals operates as a subsidiary of OQ, an integrated energy firm headquartered in Oman. This force majeure event not only underscores the intricate interconnections within global supply chains but also highlights the resilience and adaptability demonstrated by companies such as OQ Chemicals in the face of operational adversities.

	As the situation unfolds, stakeholders across various industries will remain vigilant, recognizing that the repercussions of this disruption could reverberate throughout global markets. This incident serves as a poignant reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in complex supply chains and underscores the critical importance of robust contingency planning. With a steadfast focus on recovery and resilience, OQ Chemicals is navigating through these turbulent times with the aim of emerging stronger and more adaptable to the ever-evolving global landscape.

Title: Cepsa constructs Spain's first isopropyl alcohol plant  - Fibre2Fashion
Text: The new IPA plant, backed by a €75 million (~$80.25 million)  investment, will be located in Palos de la Frontera (Huelva) and will be the first plant of its kind in Spain to use green hydrogen and capable to replace fossil-based raw materials in the production of isopropyl alcohol with sustainable alternatives. This will expand Cepsa Química's range of more sustainable products, in line with Cepsa's Positive Motion energy transition strategy.
Text: For José María Solana, CEO of Cepsa Química, the IPA project “is a very important step in our Next Chemicals in Positive Motion strategy. The plant will be linked to our Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley, ensuring that our activities are fully in line with our commitment to advance the fight against climate change and accelerate the ecological transition. It will also strengthen Spain's supply autonomy in these types of products.”
Text: This new plant will guarantee our country consistent and high-quality access to this essential product, which is critical to sectors such as the medical and pharmaceutical industries. It will also reduce our dependence on isopropyl alcohol-based disinfectants from third countries.
Text: The regional minister of Industry, Energy, and Mines of the Government of Andalusia, Jorge Paradela, emphasized that Cepsa's new chemical plant in Palos is "a tangible example of how innovation, sustainability, and job creation can go hand in hand, driving economic growth and the well-being of European society."
Text: In Jorge Paradela's words, with this investment by Cepsa, "it is demonstrated that energy at competitive prices is a factor in industrial location," and he highlighted that it will contribute decisively to "Spain gaining strategic autonomy by being the first facility in the country to produce the raw material for making renewable-origin hydroalcoholic gel."
Text: Isopropyl alcohol is also used as a solvent in the manufacturing of paints, coatings, and printing inks, as well as an intermediate in the production of key ingredients in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agrochemical industries.
Text: The new facility, scheduled for completion by the end of 2025, will have a production capacity of 80,000 tons per year. It’s estimated that approximately 400,000 hours of work will be required to build this new plant, including both direct and indirect labor.
Text: Synergies with the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley
Text: Cepsa's chemical business – and the new IPA plant – will benefit from its proximity to the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley and the largest second-generation biofuels plant that Cepsa is building, as part of a joint venture with Bio-Oils, next to the La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva. The location of the new facility adjacent to the chemical plant and the La Rábida Energy Park will allow the three facilities to be highly integrated, creating strong industrial and economic synergies. In this regard, it is worth noting that the supply of acetone required for IPA production will come from Cepsa's chemical plant, thus increasing its added value. In addition, the hydrogen (raw material) will be provided by the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley.
Text: From the start, the plant will be able to use both renewable energy and raw materials, in line with Cepsa's commitments and the development of its "Positive Motion" strategy. The energy supply (thermal and electrical) required for IPA production is thus planned to come from renewable sources.
Text: The construction of this new plant will strengthen the new chemical industry in Spain and allow Cepsa to diversify its product portfolio, positioning the company as a leader in the Iberian Peninsula market and making it one of the main producers and references of isopropyl alcohol in the European Union.
Text: In this regard, the company has been a global pioneer in the development of more sustainable LAB and phenol, which maintain the same technical properties as the traditional product, but with a lower carbon footprint. These products, called NextLab and NextPhenol, make up this new portfolio (Next), whose production is based on renewable and recycled raw materials and renewable energy use. Cepsa Química has also developed and validated a certification system for this carbon footprint reduction, complying with international standards in the field.

Title: OQ Chemicals Announces Price Increase for 2-Ethylhexanol, Effective from March 2024
Text: Welcome To ChemAnalyst
Text: 
	Prices of 2 Ethyl hexanol (2-EH) are anticipated to increase globally as OQ Chemical, a leading oxo-alcohol manufacturer announces price hikes for the for the product in the global market with effective from March 1, 2024. On February 15, 2024, OQ Chemicals announced prices hikes of EUR 100/MT for the European market and 110/MT in the prices of 2-EH for the North American, and Asian market respectively. 

	In terms of supply, prices of feedstock Propylene (Chemical Grade) are further anticipated to show an increment in the global market which is anticipated to increase production costs of 2-EH. The present challenges in the supply chain system were recorded to have been persistent which continued to increase transportation costs. 

	On the demand side, demand of 2-EH from the downstream plasticizer and paint industry from the construction and automotive sector was recorded to be healthy in North American and Asian markets. Across the US market, commercial building and housebuilding segments mainly provided support for the 2-EH market as mortgage rates were recorded to have increased with current mortgage rates being recorded at 6.77% and 6.12% for a 30-year and 15-year fixed term contract, respectively. In terms of the commercial building segment, major hotel players were recorded to have observed an increment in the number of projects and renovations therefore further pressuring the demand for 2-EH. Moreover, despite the automotive sector continuing to witness a slowdown, residential housebuilding sector continued to improve on the back of perennial shortage of secondhand homes in the US market as evidenced by an increment in the number of outlays, and an anticipated high demand for housing in the spring months. 

	In the European market, prices of 2-EH continued to be driven increasing production costs of feedstock Propylene which continued to show an increment of 1.3% during the first half of February 2024, mainly due to crisis at the Red Sea which delayed imports of the feedstock from the exporting US market.  In terms of demand, demand for 2-EH continued to remain subdued as the construction sector continued to remain in retrenchment during February 2024, with project cancellations and declining permits. All three segments of the construction sector continued to remain subdued with significant contractions being witnessed in the housebuilding, commercial building, and civil engineering activities. This consequently continued to have a detrimental impact on the downstream plasticizer industry.

	Across the Asian market, the market situation of 2-EH was also driven by high freight charges which led to expensive imports of the product and a moderate demand from the downstream plasticizer industry as demand returns due to upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year which is expected to witness an increment in the renovation activities.

	Prices of 2 Ethyl hexanol (2-EH) are anticipated to increase globally as OQ Chemical, a leading oxo-alcohol manufacturer announces price hikes for the for the product in the global market with effective from March 1, 2024. On February 15, 2024, OQ Chemicals announced prices hikes of EUR 100/MT for the European market and 110/MT in the prices of 2-EH for the North American, and Asian market respectively. 
Text: 
	In terms of supply, prices of feedstock Propylene (Chemical Grade) are further anticipated to show an increment in the global market which is anticipated to increase production costs of 2-EH. The present challenges in the supply chain system were recorded to have been persistent which continued to increase transportation costs. 
Text: 
	On the demand side, demand of 2-EH from the downstream plasticizer and paint industry from the construction and automotive sector was recorded to be healthy in North American and Asian markets. Across the US market, commercial building and housebuilding segments mainly provided support for the 2-EH market as mortgage rates were recorded to have increased with current mortgage rates being recorded at 6.77% and 6.12% for a 30-year and 15-year fixed term contract, respectively. In terms of the commercial building segment, major hotel players were recorded to have observed an increment in the number of projects and renovations therefore further pressuring the demand for 2-EH. Moreover, despite the automotive sector continuing to witness a slowdown, residential housebuilding sector continued to improve on the back of perennial shortage of secondhand homes in the US market as evidenced by an increment in the number of outlays, and an anticipated high demand for housing in the spring months. 
Text: 
	In the European market, prices of 2-EH continued to be driven increasing production costs of feedstock Propylene which continued to show an increment of 1.3% during the first half of February 2024, mainly due to crisis at the Red Sea which delayed imports of the feedstock from the exporting US market.  In terms of demand, demand for 2-EH continued to remain subdued as the construction sector continued to remain in retrenchment during February 2024, with project cancellations and declining permits. All three segments of the construction sector continued to remain subdued with significant contractions being witnessed in the housebuilding, commercial building, and civil engineering activities. This consequently continued to have a detrimental impact on the downstream plasticizer industry.

Title: Chemical price fluctuations force strategic shifts, say analysts - BusinessToday
Text: Feedback
Text: Amid fluctuating price trends in the chemicals industry in May and early June, analysts are observing significant shifts among key market players. Benzene prices spiked substantially, while propylene, acetone, and phenol prices were relatively stable.
Text: This disparity led to a 16% drop in phenol-acetone spreads, prompting companies like Deepak Nitrite to pivot towards increased isopropyl alcohol (IPA) sales, capitalising on more favourable IPA realisation rates.
Text: “Benzene prices have surged by about 5% month-on-month (MoM), impacting major chemical producers such as Deepak Nitrite, Aarti Industries, and Atul,” noted Krishan Parwani and Siddhinathan KN, equity research analysts at JM Financial, an investment banking firm.
Text: Toluene prices followed suit with an approximate 4% MoM increase, further influencing these companies. Despite stable acetone and phenol prices, the unchanged propylene prices contributed to the decline in phenol-acetone spreads.
Text: Polycarbonate (PC) prices, a key indicator for phenol pricing, remained flat MoM but saw a 2% increase quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Industry reports indicate a decline in PC consumption in China, with supply levels remaining high and capacity utilisation at around 76%. “PC demand is expected to stay muted in the short term, delaying a price rebound. However, the recent PC price uptick suggests a potential future increase in phenol prices,” Parwani and Siddhinathan KN highlighted.
Text: Bromine prices exhibited stability, rising by 3% MoM but dropping by 1% QoQ due to weak downstream product demand, with spot prices at $3.1 per kg. The analysts noted ongoing challenges for companies like Archean due to continued weak demand and pricing.
Text: The refrigerant gas market experienced mixed trends, with domestic prices for R32 and R410A rising by 5% and 18% QoQ, respectively, while R134A prices fell by 5% in the first quarter of FY25. Conversely, the US market saw downward trends for R32 and R125, with declines of 6% and 23% QoQ, respectively, while R134A prices remained flat. “Increased demand from domestic and Middle Eastern markets is expected to enhance the overall refrigerant gas pricing environment, benefiting companies like SRF,” said Parwani and Siddhinathan KN.
Text: Additionally, the ethyl acetate-acetic acid spreads witnessed a slight dip of 1% MoM due to minor declines in both ethyl acetate and acetic acid prices. An impending increase in acetic acid prices in July 2024 could further pressure companies like GNFC and Laxmi Organics. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prices in early June 2024 saw a rise of approximately 3% MoM, while ethylene dichloride prices decreased by 4% MoM. “This trend is likely to result in a sequential increase in PVC spreads,” the analysts added, highlighting Chemplast Sanmar and Reliance Industries (RIL) as key PVC manufacturers in India.
Text: In light of the current market dynamics, JM Financial has recommended SRF in the large-cap category, Deepak Nitrite in mid-cap, and PCBL in small-cap as top picks for investors.

Title: As January Comes to a Close, Isopropyl Alcohol Stocks Rise Across North America
Text: Welcome To ChemAnalyst
Text: 
As of January 2024, the pricing landscape for Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) in the North American region, particularly the United States, experienced a substantial decrease compared to the preceding month. Simultaneously, the cumulative inventory of Isopropyl Alcohol across the region exhibited an upward trend. This surge in IPA stocks signifies a dynamic market scenario, influenced by factors impacting both external supplies and overall consumption patterns.

Analyzing the specifics, external deliveries of Isopropyl Alcohol to various other regions were reported as more than adequate, bolstered by a general decline in demand from downstream sectors such as pharmaceuticals, personal care, disinfectants, and various industrial applications. Meanwhile, collective consumption during this period maintained a moderate to lower level, effectively balanced by a robust supply side. These market trajectories illuminate the intricate interplay between supply and demand dynamics, delineating the current state of the Isopropyl Alcohol market in the region.

Looking ahead, industry expectations include the commencement of new Isopropyl Alcohol production facilities in 2024, albeit at a more restrained pace. The augmented Isopropyl Alcohol inventories, as indicated by the latest data, prompt a closer examination of external factors influencing the market. Global supply chain dynamics, trade patterns, regional demand, economic climate, and industry-specific considerations collectively contribute to nuanced fluctuations in Isopropyl Alcohol stocks.

However, on the feedstock side, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, particularly propylene, a key feedstock for IPA production, have impacted the overall pricing dynamics of IPA throughout January 2024. The significant surge in raw material costs has influenced the final product's price, resulting in adjustments in supply chain dynamics. In response, manufacturers absorbed some of the increased costs initially to maintain competitiveness or honor existing contracts, supported by inventory buffers held by merchants who possess existing stock purchased at lower prices. Furthermore, global oversupply of Isopropyl Alcohol, intensifying competition among suppliers, and enhanced production efficiency and capacity expansion by key manufacturers have collectively contributed to the oversupply situation and subsequent price reduction.

The decrease in Isopropyl Alcohol prices is expected to bring relief to various sectors. Medical and pharmaceutical industries, in particular, may benefit from the reduced cost of IPA, widely used in hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and pharmaceutical products. Additionally, the lowered IPA prices are anticipated to positively impact businesses in the cosmetics, electronics, and cleaning industries, where Isopropyl Alcohol plays a vital role in diverse applications. Nevertheless, industry experts caution that market dynamics are subject to change, with external factors like geopolitical events and fluctuations in raw material costs potentially influencing the trajectory of Isopropyl Alcohol prices in the coming months.

Title: Isopropyl Alcohol Prices Set to Skyrocket: Limited Supplies Meet Rising Production Costs 
Text: Welcome To ChemAnalyst
Text: 
	In a significant development impacting industries reliant on Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA), prices are likely to surge considerably in April 2024, driven by escalating production costs, including higher propylene prices and increased upstream crude oil costs. This surge poses challenges for various sectors, ranging from pharmaceuticals to cosmetics to industrial manufacturing.

	The rise in Isopropyl Alcohol prices is expected to be attributed to several factors, foremost among them being the elevated costs of its key feedstock, Propylene. Propylene, a crucial component in the production of Isopropyl Alcohol, has experienced a notable increase in prices, primarily due to supply constraints and heightened demand within the end-user sectors. Furthermore, the production phase has witnessed temporary shutdowns in USA factories regarding the feedstock propylene since previous months thereby disrupting output. This is further expected to remain affected even in the entire month of April as various plants are likely to remain shut down until the middle of April, resulting in a significant shortage of feed material hence creating a shortage for the downstream production of  Isopropyl Alcohol across, creating an overall complex scenario.

	In the movement phase, ahead of limited production coupled with the anticipation of heightened demand arriving from the downstream pharmaceuticals, solvents, and other sectors for Isopropyl Alcohol, port operations are further expected to slow down during the month causing delays in shipping and container movement, which may considerably affect both raw material deliveries and finished product exports including Isopropyl Alcohol, resulting in a further price rise. However,  ahead of the persistent rise in regional quotations, this rapid depletion of existing inventories of Isopropyl Alcohol directly affects its availability, raising concerns among merchants and downstream traders about potential production limitations due to shortages or shutdowns of propylene plants. In response to this, businesses are encouraged to proactively prepare for these disruptions by securing supplies and mitigating risks. Keeping abreast of market trends and exploring alternative sourcing options becomes imperative for navigating the Isopropyl Alcohol supply chain landscape. While the impact of these challenges may be temporary, their significance underscores the importance of strategic planning and adaptability in the face of dynamic global events. Furthermore, certain companies might explore renegotiating contracts and employing strategic sourcing methods to efficiently manage procurement expenses thereby accepting the goods even at a higher cost.

As per the ChemAnalyst, across the North American region, certain plants were listed that undergo maintenance concerning the feedstock propylene in the month of April:



	As the Isopropyl Alcohol market navigates these challenges, stakeholders are closely monitoring developments in feedstock markets, crude oil prices, and regulatory environments to anticipate future trends and adapt their strategies accordingly. Amidst evolving market dynamics, proactive collaboration and strategic decision-making will be essential to mitigate the impact of the price surge and ensure the resilience of industries reliant on Isopropyl Alcohol.

Text: Chapter 797 of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) outlines the correct procedures and requirements for preparing compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).
Text: It establishes standards and provides guidelines for any healthcare setting engaged in the compounding of sterile products. Failure to adhere to safe CSP practices may result in harm, including death, to patients, attributable to factors such as microbial contamination, variability in ingredient strength, the use of substandard ingredients, or unintended chemical or physical contaminants.

USP 797 sets out a roadmap for achieving CSP control, which starts with good environmental design and engineering. Still, the human factor is critically important. Properly trained and competent employees are the key to CSP integrity and safety.
Text: There are many detailed sections of USP 797. Let's address the clean room, a critically important area in USP compliance. Here are 7 USP 797 clean room guidelines that you and your staff must understand and follow.
Text: Before entering the buffer area or the segregated compounding area (SCA), personnel must do the following to ensure effective fit of personal protective equipment and minimize the risk of contaminating the compounding environment:
Text: Anyone entering the compounding area must wear low-lint shoe covers, face masks, hair covers and gowns, and sterile gloves. All garb must be sterile if performing category 3 compounding. Perform hand hygiene as described in facility standard operating procedures.  These steps are important because compounding personnel are the greatest source of microbial and particulate contamination.
Text: Take the guesswork out of USP medication compounding compliance with a customizable, mobile, evidence-based solution.
Text: Use a sporicidal disinfectant, EPA-registered disinfectant, or sterile 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to wipe down any products entering the clean room.  Personnel must wear gloves during this process and disinfectant agents must be allowed to dwell for sufficient contact time before moving products into the compounding area.  These practices reduce bioburden and microbial contamination on supplies used for compounding. 
Text: The entire compounding environment, which includes the clean rooms and ante-rooms or the SCA, must be cleaned and disinfected daily on days when compounding occurs. This includes floors, pass-through chambers, and frequently touched work surfaces outside the hood. Additionally, ceilings, walls, shelving, and bins must be cleaned monthly. Sporicidal disinfectants must be applied at least monthly throughout the hoods and rooms. Sterile disinfectant and sporicidal agents are required for cleaning within the hoods. Pay attention to cleaning and disinfecting supplies, such as wipers, pads, and mop heads which must be low-lint, and disposable if possible.

If cleaning tools are reusable, they must be dedicated for use within specific areas, not removed from classified areas or the SCA, and constructed from cleanable materials (avoiding porous materials like wood). 
Text: Ensure that your facility has a modern clean room environment.

Title: USA Isopropyl Alcohol Prices Expected to Rise as Q4 2023 Commences
Text: Welcome To ChemAnalyst
Text: 
	Astonishingly, Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) prices across the United States are projected to witness a sudden incremented trend, parting manufacturers, consumers, and businesses scrambling to cope with the economic implications. This alarming surge, which began in early October 2023, has been further attributed to an acute shortage caused by disrupting supply chain activities. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions and trade disputes among major exporting and consuming nations have added another factor to the existing challenges.

	The Market experts stated that this rise in the prices of IPA can be traced back to several factors. First, the ongoing disruptions increase has severely impacted IPA production and distribution. Many manufacturing units faced a temporary closure during the first week of October, while transportation restrictions further hampered the movement of essential raw materials, including propylene, a key ingredient used to produce IPA. Additionally, the increased demand for IPA as a crucial component in making hand sanitizers and disinfectants in the pharmaceutical industries further strained supplies.

	Furthermore, the supply chain issue from the exporting nations is one of the major drives for this month's rise in the prices of IPA across the United States. Due to the temporary suspension of operational activities in exporting countries, manufacturing units may experience weekly or monthly closures. These closures can be attributed to factors like maintenance requirements, the occurrence of festivals, or related celebrations, resulting in reduced labor within the units. This is likely to affect the overall global supply chain momentum during the entire month of October, keeping the prices of IPA in the northerly direction.

	Moreover, apart from that, the consumption of propylene has surged across multiple sectors, including the automotive, packaging, and construction sectors. Also, the reopening of economies post-pandemic has further exacerbated this demand as industries ramp up production to meet rebounding consumer necessities for both upstream and downstream products such as IPA.

	Parallely, a significant rise in crude oil prices during the same timeframe also contributed to this price rise. According to US Energy Information Administration data, the US crude oil inventory draws resumed in the second week amid a counter-seasonal uptick in refinery demand and strong export momentum. Because of a larger-than-expected drawdown in US storage and rising tensions in the Middle East that could disrupt oil supplies from the region—Iran has called for an oil embargo on Israel—oil prices spiked by about 2% to a two-week high as of mid-October. The price rise has led to an increase in the cost of byproducts derived from crude oil, such as propylene, which is a key component used in the production of IPA.

	In conclusion, the IPA market has experienced a price decline in the past months; however, as winter draws near, Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) prices are beginning to rebound due to increasing consumption in various pharmaceuticals and other industrial sector throughout the month of October and forthcoming period as well.

Title: 
	Cepsa Begins Construction of a Plant to Produce 80,000 mt of Isopropyl Alcohol in Spain

Text: Cepsa is boosting its chemical business with the development of a new industrial activity that represents an advance and improvement in the diversification of its products The company has started work on a new isopropyl alcohol (IPA) plant, a product that is not only found in hydroalcoholic gels due to its biocidal properties, but also in cleaning products for both household and industry.
Text: Image Credit: Cepsa
Text: This new plant, with an investment of 75 million euros, will be located in the south of Spain, more specifically in the city of Palos de la Frontera (Huelva), and will be able to replace fossil-based raw materials in the production of isopropyl alcohol with sustainable raw materials. This will expand Cepsa Química's platform of more sustainable products, in line with Cepsa's Positive Motion energy transition strategy.
Text: Isopropyl alcohol is used in the medical and pharmaceutical sectors and is also used as a solvent in the manufacture of paints, coatings, and printing inks, as well as an intermediate in the production of key ingredients in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and agrochemical industries.
Text: For Cepsa Química’s CEO, José María Solana the IPA project “is a very important step in our Next Chemicals in Positive Motion strategy. The facility will be connected to our Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley and, therefore, the activity will be perfectly aligned with our commitment to advance in the fight against climate change and accelerate the ecological transition, while providing Spain with greater autonomy of supply in this type of products".
Text: The new facility, which will be constructed by the end of 2025, will have a production capacity of 80,000 tons per year. It is estimated that the construction of this new plant will require around 400,000 hours of work, including direct and indirect labour.
Text: Cepsa's chemical business – and the new IPA plant – will benefit from its proximity to the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley and the largest second-generation biofuels plant that Cepsa is building, as part of a joint venture with Bio-Oils, next to the La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva. The location of the new facility adjacent to the chemical plant and the La Rábida Energy Park will allow the three facilities to be highly integrated, creating strong industrial and economic synergies. In this regard, it is worth noting that the supply of acetone required for IPA production will come from Cepsa's chemical plant, thus increasing its added value. In addition, the hydrogen (raw material) will be provided by the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley.
Text: From the beginning, the facility will be prepared to use both energy and raw materials of renewable origin, in line with the commitments and development of Cepsa's “Positive Motion” strategy. In this sense, it is expected that, from the beginning, the supply of the necessary heat energy (gas and electricity) to produce IPA will be of renewable origin.
Text: The construction of this new plant will enable Cepsa to diversify its product portfolio, placing the company in a leading position in the Iberian Peninsula market and making it one of the main producers and benchmarks for isopropyl alcohol in the European Union.
Text: In this sense, the company has been a pioneer in the world in the development of more sustainable LAB and Phenol that maintain the same technical characteristics as the traditional products, but with a lower carbon footprint. These products, called NextLab and NextPhenol, make up this new portfolio (Next), whose production is based on renewable and recycled raw materials and the use of renewable energies. Cepsa Química has also developed and certified a certification system for this carbon footprint reduction that complies with international standards in this area.

Text: As California transitions rapidly to renewable fuels, it needs new technologies that can store power for the electric grid. Solar power drops at night and declines in winter. Wind power ebbs and flows. As a result, the state depends heavily on natural gas to smooth out highs and lows of renewable power.
Text: “The electric grid uses energy at the same rate that you generate it, and if you’re not using it at that time, and you can’t store it, you must throw it away,” said Robert Waymouth, the Robert Eckles Swain Professor in Chemistry in the School of Humanities and Sciences.
Text: Waymouth is leading a Stanford team to explore an emerging technology for renewable energy storage: liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs). Hydrogen is already used as fuel or a means for generating electricity, but containing and transporting it is tricky.
Text: “We are developing a new strategy for selectively converting and long-term storing of electrical energy in liquid fuels,” said Waymouth, senior author of a study detailing this work in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. “We also discovered a novel, selective catalytic system for storing electrical energy in a liquid fuel without generating gaseous hydrogen.”
Text: Batteries used to store electricity for the grid – plus smartphone and electric vehicle batteries – use lithium-ion technologies. Due to the scale of energy storage, researchers continue to search for systems that can supplement those technologies.
Text: According to the California Energy Commission: “From 2018 to 2024, battery storage capacity in California increased from 500 megawatts to more than 10,300 MW, with an additional 3,800 MW planned to come online by the end of 2024. The state projects 52,000 MW of battery storage will be needed by 2045.”
Text: Among the candidates are LOHCs, which can store and release hydrogen using catalysts and elevated temperatures. Someday, LOHCs could widely function as “liquid batteries,” storing energy and efficiently returning it as usable fuel or electricity when needed.
Text: The Waymouth team studies isopropanol and acetone as ingredients in hydrogen energy storage and release systems. Isopropanol – or rubbing alcohol – is a high-density liquid form of hydrogen that could be stored or transported through existing infrastructure until it’s time to use it as a fuel in a fuel cell or to release the hydrogen for use without emitting carbon dioxide.
Text: Yet methods to produce isopropanol with electricity are inefficient. Two protons from water and two electrons can be converted into hydrogen gas, then a catalyst can produce isopropanol from this hydrogen. “But you don’t want hydrogen gas in this process,” said Waymouth. “Its energy density per unit volume is low. We need a way to make isopropanol directly from protons and electrons without producing hydrogen gas.”
Text: Daniel Marron, lead author of this study who recently completed his Stanford PhD in chemistry, identified how to address this issue. He developed a catalyst system to combine two protons and two electrons with acetone to generate the LOHC isopropanol selectively, without generating hydrogen gas. He did this using iridium as the catalyst.
Text: A key surprise was that cobaltocene was the magic additive. Cobaltocene, a chemical compound of cobalt, a non-precious metal, has long been used as a simple reducing agent and is relatively inexpensive. The researchers found that cobaltocene is unusually efficient when used as a co-catalyst in this reaction, directly delivering protons and electrons to the iridium catalyst rather than liberating hydrogen gas, as was previously expected.
Text: Cobalt is already a common material in batteries and in high demand, so the Stanford team is hoping their new understanding of cobaltocene’s properties could help scientists develop other catalysts for this process. For example, the researchers are exploring more abundant, non-precious earth metal catalysts, such as iron, to make future LOHC systems more affordable and scalable.
Text: “This is basic fundamental science, but we think we have a new strategy for more selectively storing electrical energy in liquid fuels,” said Waymouth.
Text: As this work evolves, the hope is that LOHC systems could improve energy storage for industry and energy sectors or for individual solar or wind farms.
Text: And for all the complicated and challenging work behind the scenes, the process, as summarized by Waymouth, is actually quite elegant: “When you have excess energy, and there’s no demand for it on the grid, you store it as isopropanol. When you need the energy, you can return it as electricity.”
Text: Additional Stanford co-authors are Conor Galvin, PhD ’23, and PhD student Julia Dressel. Waymouth is also a member of Stanford Bio-X and the Stanford Cancer Institute, a faculty fellow of Sarafan ChEM-H, and an affiliate of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.
